# Ping CRM

This is a fork of Ping CRM used for the Laracasts series "Pest From Scratch".

Each episode has a corresponding branch. You can check out the branch for the episode you're watching to see the code at that point in time.
From episode 9 onwards, there is a docker-compose file that you can use to run the application. You can run `docker-compose up -d` to start the application.

Use a command like `docker-compose exec -it php /bin/bash` to run commands in the app container.

There is a `pest` bash alias configured, so you can just run `pest` to execute the test suite!
